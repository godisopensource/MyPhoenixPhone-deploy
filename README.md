# MyPhoenixPhone

A dormant device buyback platform that leverages [Orange Network APIs](https://developer.orange.com/products/network-apis/) to detect inactive phone numbers, verify device eligibility, and facilitate device collection through multiple handover methods (shipping, in-store, donation). This development project is part of the [Orange Network APIs 2025 hackathon](https://hackathon.developer.orange.com/). 

## Architecture Overview

MyPhoenixPhone is a full-stack TypeScript monorepo built with Turborepo:

- **Backend** (NestJS): RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation, OAuth2 consent flows, SMS verification, device pricing, dormant detection workers, and Camara Network API integration
- **Web** (Next.js 15): Customer-facing application with Orange Boosted design system, consent management, eligibility checking, and verification flows
- **Packages**: Shared UI components, TypeScript configs, ESLint configs, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for AI agent integration

### Key Features

- **Device Eligibility**: Check if a phone number is eligible for buyback based on network signals (SIM swap detection, reachability status)
- **OAuth2 Consent**: Secure consent flow using Orange Authentication France for accessing user network data
- **SMS Verification**: Two-factor authentication via SMS codes
- **Dormant Detection**: Background workers that analyze cohorts of leads to identify dormant devices using Camara Network APIs
- **Pricing Engine**: Dynamic device valuation based on model, condition, and market data
- **Handover Methods**: Multiple collection options (ship device, drop at store, donate to charity)
- **Campaign Management**: Marketing campaigns with A/B testing and feature flags
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 382+ tests across 8 layers (unit, integration, E2E, performance, contract testing with Pact)

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (recommended via nvm)
- **npm 10+** (Corepack enabled by default on Node 20)
- **PostgreSQL 14+** for the backend database
- **Docker** (optional, for integration tests with testcontainers)
- **k6** (optional, for performance testing)
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (macOS only, required for building native packages like sharp)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://codeberg.org/godisopensource/MyPhoenixPhone
cd MyPhoenixPhone
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

From the monorepo root, install all dependencies for all workspaces (backend, web, packages):

```sh
cd myphoenixphone
corepack enable
npm ci
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `myphoenixphone/apps/backend/`:

```sh
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/myphoenixphone"

# Server
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Session
SESSION_SECRET="your-session-secret-change-in-production"

# Orange Network APIs (Camara)
CAMARA_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
CAMARA_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
CAMARA_BASE_URL="https://api.orange.com"

# Orange Authentication France (OAuth2)
AUTH_FRANCE_CLIENT_ID="your-auth-client-id"
AUTH_FRANCE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-auth-secret"
AUTH_FRANCE_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/api/consent/callback"

# Admin API (optional)
ADMIN_TOKEN="your-admin-token"

# Feature Flags (optional)
ENABLE_DORMANT_WORKERS="true"
```

### 4. Setup Database

Run Prisma migrations:

```sh
cd myphoenixphone/apps/backend
npm run prisma:migrate:dev
```

Generate Prisma client:

```sh
npm run prisma:generate
```

### 5. Load Demo Data (Optional)

For testing and demonstrations, load sample data.

IMPORTANT: The Orange Network APIs playground used for demos enforces a quota on the number of phone numbers that can exist in the account. The current demo setup uses 10 playground slots. Before running the seeder you must:

- start the local MCP playground proxy (see `/MCP_SETUP.md`)
- ensure the 10 demo phone numbers are present in the playground (see `/myphoenixphone/scripts/create-playground-phones.ts`)

Run the Prisma demo seeder after MCP playground phone numbers are configured:

```sh
npm run seed:demo
```

Notes:
- The seeder populates the local PostgreSQL database (Prisma). It does NOT automatically create phone numbers in the Orange playground â€” those must be created/updated via the MCP tools prior to running the seeder.
- We use the following 10 playground numbers for demo scenarios (source: `myphoenixphone/scripts/create-playground-phones.ts`):

   1. +33699901001 â€” Candidat Parfait
   2. +33699901002 â€” SIM Swap RÃ©cent
   3. +33699901003 â€” Utilisateur Actif
   4. +33699901004 â€” Avec Consentement
   5. +33699901005 â€” VÃ©rifiÃ© par SMS
   6. +33699901006 â€” Avec Tarification
   7. +33699901007 â€” Livraison Choisie
   8. +33699901008 â€” A RefusÃ© (Opt-Out)
   9. +33699901009 â€” En Campagne
 10. +33699901010 â€” Multi-Contacts

See `/ACTIONS_DEMO.md` for the step-by-step MCP actions (create/update/delete) used to configure each playground number's metadata (SIM swap date, reachability, location, roaming).

**ðŸ“š Demo Mode Guide**: See `apps/web/DEMO_MODE.md` for instructions on using the interactive demo mode in the web app.

### 6. Start Development Servers

From the monorepo root `myphoenixphone/`:

```sh
# Start all services in parallel (backend + web + MCP server)
npm run dev:local

# OR start individually:
npm run dev -w apps/backend   # Backend API on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev -w apps/web        # Web app on http://localhost:3001
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` with OpenAPI documentation at `http://localhost:3000/api`.

## How It Works

### 1. Lead Collection

Marketing campaigns collect phone numbers (leads) from various channels. Each lead is stored with campaign metadata and tracking information.

### 2. Eligibility Check

When a user submits their phone number:

1. The system checks network signals via Camara APIs:
   - SIM swap detection (has the SIM been changed recently?)
   - Reachability status (is the device currently connected to the network?)
   - Location verification (optional)

2. Business rules determine eligibility:
   - Recent SIM swap might indicate device abandonment
   - Unreachable device suggests it's powered off or inactive
   - Eligibility rules can be customized via feature flags

### 3. Consent Flow

For accessing detailed network data, the system requires user consent via OAuth2:

1. User initiates consent via `/api/consent/init`
2. Backend redirects to Orange Authentication France
3. User authenticates and approves data access
4. Orange redirects back with authorization code
5. Backend exchanges code for access token and stores consent proof

### 4. Device Verification

After consent, the user can:

1. Receive an SMS verification code via `/api/verification/send`
2. Submit the code via `/api/verification/verify`
3. Get accurate device information and pricing

### 5. Pricing & Handover

Once verified:

1. User provides device details (model, condition)
2. Pricing engine calculates buyback value
3. User selects handover method:
   - **Ship**: Free shipping label generated
   - **Store**: QR code for in-store drop-off
   - **Donate**: Tax deduction receipt

### 6. Background Workers

Daily cron jobs process large cohorts of leads:

1. **DailyRefreshWorker**: Fetches fresh network signals for active leads
2. **DormantDetectionWorker**: Analyzes signals to identify dormant devices
3. **CampaignEnrichmentWorker**: Enriches lead data with network intelligence

Workers use rate limiting and batch processing to handle thousands of API calls efficiently.
